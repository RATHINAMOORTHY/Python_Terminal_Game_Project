# Python_Terminal_Game_Project

It's time to actually make a simple command line game so put together everything
you've learned so far about Python. The game goes like this:

1. The computer will think of 3 digit number that has no repeating digits.
2. You will then guess a 3 digit number
3. The computer will then give back clues, the possible clues are:

    - Close: You've guessed a correct number but in the wrong position
    - Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position
    - Nope: You haven't guess any of the numbers correctly

4. Based on these clues you will guess again until you break the code with a
   perfect match!

This game will be the card game "War" for two players, you an the computer. If you don't know how to play "War" here are the basic rules:

The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
in front of him.

The Play:

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
(six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

There are some more variations on this but we will keep it simple for now.
Ignore "double" wars
